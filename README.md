A lean approach for loopback-next projects.

Major modifications are:

- Changed code-formatting to eliminate semicolons and trailing commas. 
- Added `oasgraphql` for GraphQL server auto-generation.
- Implemented `dev` and `watch` scripts supporting live reloading.
- Pruned all the linting scripts to a single `lint` script.
- Removed other non-essential scripts.
- Minimized `.vscode` config.
